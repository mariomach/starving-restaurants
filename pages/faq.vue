            <strong> 1. What is the minimum gift card amount that I can buy?</strong>
            <br></br>
            The minimum purchase amount is $10. You will receive the gift cards through email and you should be set for 5 years before they expire. 
            <br></br>
            <strong> 2. Isn't a 30% discount too much? Wouldn't this sink the restaurant further into the ground?</strong>
            <br></br>
            There's two ways to look at this. 
            <br></br>Firstly, it is more valuable for the restaurant to have cash on hand. Some restaurants are already offering discounts,
            but they lack customer reach which is what this platform provides.
            <br></br>Secondly, restaurant fixed costs is what is crushing them. Variable costs (i.e. food) is not the problem.
            Rather, the more money that is cutting into their variable expenses, the better it works for them because it increases
            their margins.
