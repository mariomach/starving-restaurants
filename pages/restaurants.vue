        Think of this as raising money with <strong>0% interest rate and no dilution in ownership. </strong>The money you've raised will
        be <strong>available for you immediately</strong> after the fundraising period.
        You will have a lump sum of cash to pay off your fixed costs. 
        This will help bring confidence and stability for your business.
        <br></br>
        In addition, because we are helping you offer gift credits to your supporter, 
        you will have a line of customers waiting outside your restaurants once the world is safe again for business.
        <br></br>
        If you are worried that you won't be able to meet all the demands from the credits you have issued, 
        do not fear.
        Since they are valid for 10 years, this will prevent everyone from jumping in all at once.
