        If you're not convinced, think of this as raising money with <strong>0% interest rate and no dilution in ownership. </strong>The money you've raised will
        be <strong>available for you immediately</strong> after the fundraising period.
        You will have a lump sum of cash to pay off your fixed costs. 
      <br></br>
        To participate, the process is very simple:

              1. A website that issues eGifts. Square offers a great platform if you don't already have one. And it is free to use!
              The only catch is they will charge you a transaction fee. You can get set up 
              <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/l/egift-cards">here</a>.
              <br></br>
              2. You must  apply a discount rate to all your cards offering. The lowest increment you can offering
              must be $10. In the future, you will need the app from Square to process these eGifts. Please keep one handy.
