            <strong> The Biggest Challenge: Getting the words out</strong>
            <br></br>
            While there is some challenges on the technical side, 
            the most important one is actually finding effective channels that can inform both the participants
            and the restaurants to take part in. Otherwise, this platform will not work. As it stands, it is a chicken and an egg problem.
            <br></br>
            To reach participants at scale in a short amount of time, companies (i.e. Microsoft) can relay this information to their employees
            through their daily/weekly COVID-19 emails that they are already sending out.
            <br></br>
            To reach restaurants at scale, it will require a combined effort from local news outlet/journalists to cover.
            And ideally, a way to incentivize food delievery professionals to inform all the restaurants they are delivering food from to
            signing up.  
            <br></br>
            <strong>Another challenge is if a restaurant ends up going under:</strong> It will also raise issues for those who have gratiously support them 
            and are expecting to use their credits.
            Having gather feedbacks from friends, we haven't found a way to minimize this risk. The best way to think of this is that you're making a
            <strong>donation</strong> to
            the restaurants with a likehood of getting rewarded.
