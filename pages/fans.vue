    Here's where you can participate to support your favourite restaurants. But wait. This is not like any other fundraiser.
    Everyone comes out happy because the more money the restaurants raise, <strong>the more money you earn back!</strong>
    Not only will all your contributions be reiumbursed back to you, but <strong>you will receive a bonus (up to 50%)</strong> for your support!
    The only catch is you can only spend the money at that restaurant.

         And in particular, you contributed $60 of the $24,230.</h6>
         <h6 class="has-text-grey">This means that not only will you receive your $60 back, but you will receive an additional $18 
         because of the 30% gratuity reward. 
         These funds will be given back to you in the form of gift certificate that you can use at that
         particular restaurant. They are valid for 10 years and can be shared or sold to others. </h6>

  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    <h6>You have the option of contributing any amount of money to any of the restaurant or coffee shops listed. If the total amount of money raised is below $2500,
     all the money will be refunded back to you. This is to minimize your risks.</h6><br>
         The game becomes more interesting <strong>once the $2500 threshold has been passed.</strong>
         From this bracket, <strong>everyone who has contributed money will receive a 10% gratuity reward on
             top of what they have contributed. </strong> 
         So if you have contributed $100 and the restaurant ends up raising $3000 at the end of the period, 
         <a>you will be issued $110</a> in credits (gift certificate) to enjoy your time at the 
         restaurant once the doors are opened again. 
    <br></br>
    These credits are valid for a period of 10 years and 
    are not locked to anyone. They can be shared or resold to others.
    <br></br>
    <h6>
        Now it becomes interesting as you reach the higher brackets. For example, if you have contributed $300 and the restaurant ends up raising $42,000, 
        
    then your total rewards becomes $450. As restaurant reach higher brackets, it is in the best interest of everyone to contribute. But there is a catchâ€¦ 

<br></br>To prevent hoarding of one restaurant once it has attained the highest bracket, there is a limit of $50,000 that each shop can raise. 

<br></br>Every day, the funding amount will be updated once at 8:00 AM PST and 4:00 PM PST on this site. <br></br>

Restaurant's registration for this public offering begins this Friday starting at 8:00 AM PST until Sunday at 6:00 PM. Participation in this offering will continue for 14 days.
